# 🏦 Simple Java Banking System

This is a beginner-friendly Java console application designed to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, including:
- Class and object creation
- Constructors
- The `this` keyword
- Encapsulation of data and behavior

It simulates a basic **Bank Account System**, where a user can:
- View balance  
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money  
- Switch between multiple accounts  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Two predefined accounts (e.g., John and Rick)
- Dynamic account switching
- Input handling with `Scanner`
- Realistic transaction logic with validation
- Clear and detailed code comments explaining every line

---

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
- **Classes and Objects:** `BankAccount` represents a real-world account.
- **Constructors:** Used to initialize account owner and balance.
- **Methods:** `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `showInfo()` define behaviors.
- **Encapsulation:** Data and methods grouped together logically.
- **Reference Management:** `activeAccount` shows how one variable can refer to different objects dynamically.
